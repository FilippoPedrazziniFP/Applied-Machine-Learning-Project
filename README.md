# Applied-Machine-Learning-Project

The repository contains the project did for the Data Mining Course at @Polimi (Politecnico di Milano - EIT Data Science Master Programme)

## Description
The objective of the course was to simulate a real business problem that can be solved using Machine Learning algorithms. The implementation went through all the standard steps for generating a meaningful solution. The final chosen model was XGBoost after the tuning of the parameters on the train set.

### Usage and Project Visualization
The main_book.ypnb contains all the implementation starting from the visualization phase to the final testing.

### Further descriptions
The repo contains the presentation done for showing the final results and the applied method.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.5
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scikitlearn
